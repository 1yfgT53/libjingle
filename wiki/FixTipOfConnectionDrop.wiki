The information on this page addresses an issue reported by libjingle users that sometime, the connection will be dropped if the client has been set idle for awhile.

= Introduction =

Some users have reported that if a connected client has been set idle for sometime, it'll be disconnected (put to offline) without any log-out request from libjingle.

There is a small workaround to resolve this issue which is to keep sending "keepalives" request to the server periodically. 

= Details =

The following is the sample code:

void
YourClientClass::DoKeepAlive() {
  buzz::XmppClient \* client = app_->GetClient();
  if (client) {
    client->SendRaw(" "); // Just send a space.
  }
}
