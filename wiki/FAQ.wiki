#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= What's is the status of libjingle? =

We just released a new version, 0.5, with many updates.  There is now support for video, and the "jingle" standard (XEP-166 and XEP-167).  Also, the license has been changed from GPL to BSD.  There are also lots of bug fixes and performance improvements.

= How does the build of 0.5 differ from 0.4? =

See the README for details.  Basically, you'll need to download one tool and two libraries:

swtoolkit: http://code.google.com/p/swtoolkit/
libsrtp: http://sourceforge.net/projects/srtp/develop
expat: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

= How does libjingle compare to other XMPP stacks? =

libjingle isn't just an XMPP stack.  It's more a P2P (peer-to-peer) and RTC (real-time communication) stack that builds on XMPP.  If you don't need any P2P or RTC, you can use any XMPP stack.  If you do, then you might want to use libjingle.  In fact, you can even use libjingle on top of another XMPP stack.

For example, if you are building an application that synchronizes data between devices, you can use any XMPP stack to send small chunks of XML through an XMPP server.  But if the data is large, then you'll need a direct socket between the peers.  You'll want libjingle for that.

libjingle is also obviously well suited to interop with Google Talk and other XMPP chat clients that work with the Jingle protocol (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html).
