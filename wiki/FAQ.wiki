#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Is libjingle dead? =

No!  A version of libjingle internal to Google has been under continual development.  We are currently preparing an update to the public version.  In the meantime, you can continue developing with version 0.4.   Updating to a newer version later shouldn't be a problem.

= How does libjingle compare to other XMPP stacks? =

libjingle isn't just an XMPP stack.  It's more a P2P (peer-to-peer) and RTC (real-time communication) stack that builds on XMPP.  If you don't need any P2P or RTC, you can use any XMPP stack.  If you do, then you might want to use libjingle.

For example, if you are building an application that synchronizes data between devices, you can use any XMPP stack to send small chunks of XML through an XMPP server.  But if the data is large, then you'll need a direct socket between the peers.  You'll want libjingle for that.

libjingle is also obviously well suited to interop with Google Talk and other XMPP chat clients that work with the Jingle protocol (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html).
